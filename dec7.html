    <p style='background-color: rgb(200, 246, 167);'><b>DECEMBER 7, 2021: the most time consuming (and satisfying) dish i've ever cooked by myself...i made soup..and i'm not even the biggest fan of soup..&#10036;</b></p>
<p>I made butternut squash miso soup! I can't recall where I got this recipe from, but I know that it was definitely inspired from the <a href="nov25.html">Thanksgiving dinner I had at Ella's.</a>Yes, now that I'm thinking of it again, I think they must've shared
their recipe with me because I didn't think that miso could be used as an ingredient within the context of soup. I've previously 
only associated miso<font color="#FF00FF"><sup>1</sup></font> with Japanese cooking.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I recorded myself cooking that day, so I've been retracing my steps! Hopefully you can follow through the recipe below.</p>
 <br>
<center><b>Step one:</b> Take your butternut squash, cut it in half, take out the seeds and then bake it for an hour to soften it up.</center>

  <br><br>

<center><b>Step two:</b> While we wait for the squash to bake, take one yellow onion and three garlic cloves<font color="#FF00FF"><sup>2</sup></font>. Dice<font color="#FF00FF"><sup>3</sup></font> them up finely.</center> 
<br><br><center><b>Step three:</b> In a small pot? Is that a small pot? Saucepan? Mix them up altogether with a squeeze of lemon juice, cumin, cinnamon powder and cayenne pepper.</center>

<center><b>Step four:</b> Scrape all of the squash out and transfer it into the saucepan. Pour two cups of vegetable stock into the mix, and add three tablespoons of red miso.</center>

<br><br><center><b>Step five:</b> After softening it up in the saucepan, take the mixture into the blender. Transfer it back to the pan and add more vegetable stock (I ended up finishing the whole carton). Let it simmer.</center>

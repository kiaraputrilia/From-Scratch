        </div>
After I finished making the soup, I realized that this just simply couldn't be my entire dinner! I'm a big gyal and a gyal's gotta eat big. I don't remember why I decided to cook this, but from the pictures
I can tell that it's shrimp with sundried tomatoes, arugula, topped with feta cheese? I am curious though, as to why I transferred the pan from the oven to the stovetop.

            But yes, here's the super abstract weird shrimp dish.

                /* Get image and change value
                of src attribute */
                let image = document.getElementById("image");
     
                image.src = "image/dec7shrimp.gif"
